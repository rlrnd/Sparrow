# Project Sparrow
Sparrow is a small research project to help identify and verify some technical architectural concepts for RL's next generation cloud based product line.

## Objectives

1. Identify all the architectural pieces and moving parts.
2. Explorer and decide the technical platform for each part.
3. Iron out technical difficulties.
4. Collect list of business/design questions for PM/BA.
5. Prepare viable hosting and On-premises hosting options.

## Requirements & Principles

* As IaaS independent as possible.
* Try to avoid expense MSSQL licenses.
* Multi-tenancy
* Internationalization/Localization
* Multi-time-zone
* Allow existing developers to switch easily

## Architectural Concerns

* Centralized identity/security mechanism to allow modular designs
* Container compatible deployment structure to allow easy deployment/management.
* Separate APIs and Applications when possible.
* Usage and performance build in.
