# Notes

Just put all concerns here to be filled and separated.

## Business

* Are we still sticking with file based model?
* Migration from existing RL6/Delphi customers.

## Technical

* Billing and usage/performance collection
* Multiple environments and trial mode

## IT

* Which IaaS to choose?

  * Azure make hosting existing RL6 easy so should we go there?
  * Heroku might give us some benefit integrating with HUB?
  * AWS as the leading player should be the safest bet?


## Management
